# Tutorial Microservice

This tutorial will go over how to build a Spring Boot based microservice using a set of provided templates to implement
a website that can contain all Entity Compiler tutorials. The microservice will not only have REST endpoints but also
security and a web interface.

### [Module 1: Getting Started](Module1)

This first module will introduce you to a spring boot application and how it is structured. Then it will help you get setup with a project directory for this tutorial microservice. Finally it will go over the entity model for this application.

### [Module 2: Building the Microservice](Module2)

This is the meat of the tutorial. It covers the building of all basic elements of a microservice from its database schema to its endpoints - as well as authenitication and authorization.

### [Module 3: Web](Module3)

Typically a microservice will stop at providing a REST API, however to show how the Entity Compiler can be used to generate a web site on top of the microservice, this module was included. It includes the synthesis of an admin console to edit the tutorials and a custom "student" website for viewing the tutorials.
